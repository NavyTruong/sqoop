DEFINITION:
SqoopTest

    UnitTest:
        A unit test shall test one class at a time having it's dependencies mocked.
        A unit test shall not start a mini cluster nor an embedded database and it shall not use a JDBC driver.

    IntegrationTest:
        An integration test shall test if independently developed classes work together correctly.
        An integration test checks a whole scenario and thus may start mini clusters or embedded databases and may
        connect to external resources like RDBMS instances.

    ManualTest:
        Deprecated category, shall not be used nor extended.


ThirdPartyTest
    A third party test shall test a scenario where a third party side is required such as a JDBC driver or an external
    RDBMS instance.

    CubridTest:
        A CubridTest shall test scenarios where a Cubrid driver and/or external instance is required.

    Db2Test:
        A DB2 test shall test scenarios where a DB2 driver and/or external instance is required.

    MainFrameTest:
        A MainFrame test shall test scenarios where a MainFrame external instance is required.

    MysqlTest:
        A MySql test shall test scenarios where a MySql driver and/or external instance is required.

    NetezzaTest:
        A Netezza test shall test scenarios where a Netezza driver and/or external instance is required.

    OracleTest:
        An Oracle test shall test scenarios where a Oracle driver and/or external instance is required.

    PostgresqlTest:
        A PostgreSql test shall test scenarios where a PostgreSql driver and/or external instance is required.

    SqlServerTest:
        An SqlServer test shall test scenarios where a SqlServer driver and/or external instance is required.


KerberizedTest
    A kerberized test shall run in kerberized environment thus it starts mini KDC server.
